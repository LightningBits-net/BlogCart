            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                Hello! I am Rafael Morel aka LightningBits, a Junior Software Developer specializing in .NET Core, Blazor, Tailwind CSS, and much more.
                I offer a combination of technical knowledge, real world experience, and a willingness to learn and contribute as part of a software development team.
                As a former union ironworker in New York City, I have built and renovated some of the world’s most iconic structures. When the Covid pandemic brought the construction industry to a halt, I was laid off.
                My wife, a nurse and frontline worker, continued to work while I stayed home with our 4-month-old baby. During this time, I recalled my early interest in coding on a Commodore 64 and 128 and saw the high demand for coding skills in the job market.
                With my infant son on my shoulder, I devoted myself to learning to code and gained new skills. My passion for problem-solving and hands-on experience in construction, provide me with a unique perspective that I bring with me to the tech industry.
                I am eager to join a software company and contribute to the creation of cutting-edge solutions with my diverse skill set and experience. I am dedicated to succeeding, innovating, and staying up to date in this field, making me a valuable asset to any software development team.
            </p>
